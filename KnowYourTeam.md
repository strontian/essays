This essay is about how getting to know the people you work with: what matters to them and how they think. Its goal is to convince you that cooperation is a skill you use all the time, and that actively working to understand the people you work with is a crucial part of that skill. We'll talk about a few different qualities of people and discusses why each is important. At the end there are some exercises you can use to get to know your team.

Why Cooperation is so Important:

Everyone cooperates all the time. Buying an ice cream cone, spending the holidays with family, finding a software bug with coworkers, going on a date, getting hired at a new job, going to school. These activities all require coordinated effort with others.

Most interactions we take part in have been designed for us, we just need to follow the script. It's possible to go through life without ever thinking about how interactions are designed. But to do the greater and more interesting things life has to offer, you need to undertake sophisticated coordination with other people, and you will need to help write the script of those interactions and relationships.

Cooperation is a broad term, so we'll focus on only a couple activities: creating plans and making agreements. Let's look at how understanding the participants helps make better plans.

How good a plan is depends on who’s doing it:

Consider the following plan: A person will move to LA for a year, spending a year's worth of living expenses, and work full time writing a script for a movie. Is it a good plan? The answer is obviously that it depends on who’s doing it. If the plan is for a fresh graduate with an accounting degree who hates writing and really wants to pay off her student loans, it might not be the best plan. For someone who has been dreaming of this for years, and doesn't mind the expense, perhaps it’s a perfect plan. Hopefully this point is obvious, but you can try imagining any other plan, even simple ones, and imagine placing different people into that plan and the same point will be true.

When you start a business with partners, you are entering in an agreement to expend a large number of resources (time, money, energy, social capital, sanity, etc) over a long period of time towards a common goal. In other words, you are making a very sophisticated and high stakes plan.

So how do you tell if it's a good plan? Hopefully, one of your first thoughts is that you still need to know so much about your partners before answering the question! 

But this leads to more questions: What's relevant to know? How can I learn it? How can I apply it?

Challenges With Getting To Know People:

There are a few challenges with getting to know people:

* There’s a lot to know! People are enormously complex. They vary dramatically in terms of their experiences, values, preferences, beliefs, desires, understandings, and tolerance for sources of pain like risk, expenses, failure - and so many other qualities.
* It’s easy to be unaware of what you don’t know. All of this complexity is invisible, and it’s surprisingly easy to forget that it exists. It takes deliberate effort to know yourself, and your partners.
* There are other barriers to communicating: People may not actually be aware of or unable to articulate some of their qualities, particularly as they pertain to something they haven’t done before. People may not feel comfortable sharing. Good faith is extremely important.

The following sections will attempt to address some of these problems by offering a few important qualities of people, and discussing why they may be relevant. We will cover three qualities of people: Preferences, Values, and Beliefs.

Preferences are what you want to get from work, for example:

* I want to avoid failure
* I want to improve at skill X because I love it
* I don’t like to think about things through the lens of X
* I want to have a job with high prestige/money/perks

Preferences are the simplest quality to communicate, understand and use. People have high awareness of them, and it’s usually not important to reach alignment on them. But they are still important when planning because they are relevant to what roles a member can fulfill, and how much they are willing or able to contribute. They are also important for making agreements among the members. 

Values are what is important to you in your work, for example:

* It’s important to delight our customers
* It’s important to be generous to employees with growth, safety, wealth, etc
* It’s important to be environmentally responsible
* It’s important that we are ethical with regards to customer data
* It’s important that we grow as fast as possible
* It’s important that we are very conservative financially

Values are important because they provide a powerful incentive to achieve your goals. Also, having a well developed and clear set of values serves as a heuristic for making decisions. This creates leverage because you can reduce the number of factors you need to consider(and disagree about) when making plans and decisions. A final and perhaps the most important reason to spend time building and communicating your values is that it inspires people to help and support you.

Beliefs compose the model of reality you use to make predictions about the future, for example:

* If this business doesn’t succeed in the first 6 months, it will never succeed
* There’s no point in doing X because Y
* Achieving A can only be done by X, Y, and Z
* The plan we are adopting will require X amount of resources (vs 4X)

Beliefs are the trickiest of all the qualities we discuss here, and less conducive to a simple planning exercise than the others. This is because the world with which we interact is preposterously complicated, and it is ‘reflexive’ meaning that changes compound on themselves and make it exponentially more difficult to predict how the future will be the farther you go forward in time.

Despite these difficulties, it cannot be overstated how much of a risk big differences in belief about the world are to partnerships. This is because people prefer making good(in their internal estimation) decisions to bad ones, if they can perceive a large difference. If you can't agree on the effects of a certain course of action, you are certainly in disagreement about its consequences, and remember those consequences need to be viewed through the lenses of one or more other people's value systems.

A team operating with a major rift in belief is akin to driving a car whose engine has started making a strange noise. It will drive fine for a while, but you are at risk of a catastrophic failure. Think of developing a practice of regularly and proactively checking on alignment of belief as installing a check engine light in your car. A good side effect of doing this is that major differences in belief about reality can indicate that there is some hidden complexity worth investigating.

This is not to say you should strive for agreement for its own sake, only that you should be aware of major rifts in belief. In my experience, working with people that see the world very differently than you is both powerful and enriching. Undoubtedly, you will operate in times of deep disagreement. How to handle that is surely interesting, but it’s outside the scope of this essay.

Finally, Some Exercises to Try:

Here are some simple exercises that can help. They can be done periodically, and can be done at various levels of organization, for instance at the company level, or at a project level. I’m certain you can improve on them, and even more certain that there are better resources you can find. But hopefully they show how easy it can be.

Exercise for understanding and aligning on Values:

1. All the stakeholders sit down together
2. Take 10 minutes to write down your values - star the values are 'sacred' to you
3. Read your values aloud + briefly explain them
4. Take a few minutes to adjust your lists by adding/removing/renaming
5. At the end write down everyone’s values, and share with the group

Optionally, you can explore the intersection of your values and create a list of values for the team. This can be consulted when trying to understand how to make decisions.

Optionally, if there is some noticeable dissonance between values, it may be worth trying to explore some scenarios where that value might be in play, and having a discussion about what you would do in that scenario. The goal being to detect a potential conflict.

Exercise for understanding your teams’ preferences:

You can do the same exercise as above, although some members may not wish to memorialize this information. For preference, it’s less important to have alignment among members, but it’s still important to have awareness of it so you can make plans and agreements accordingly.

It’s important to think of preferences in the long term as well as the short term. For instance, if one partner wants to contribute weekends for one year and is willing to spend $X in total, another partner wants to work 60 hours a week for as long was it takes, and spend whatever they can, it’s worth spending some time thinking about what happens after one of those limits is breached and maybe even making an agreement that accounts for a failure case at that time.

Tips for aligning on Beliefs:

As you make your plans, you will need to decide which goals to pursue, and develop plans to achieve them. Once you have some goals and plans written up, it’s worth passing them around to stakeholders and asking questions to try and detect large differences in belief.

Here are a few examples:

* For each goal that could be pursued how valuable/important would it be to achieve?
* If successfully executed, does the plan actually achieve the goal it is meant to?
* How likely are we to be able to successfully execute the plan?
* How much will this plan cost(in money, time, risk, or other limiting resources)?

Conclusion:

Writing this, I felt that this is a vastly important but often neglected subject, and this essay hardly scratches the surface. Nevertheless, I hope it inspired you to think about the nature of your collaborative relationships. And If you are starting a collaboration with other people, I hope you feel urged to know them better and use that knowledge to greater success.
